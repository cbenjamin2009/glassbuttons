# Glass Buttons - V1.0 Release 11/20/2021

## Author: **Chris Benjamin**

## Version: **V1.0.0**

This is created as my first package to be published. This is a V1.0 release. Please report issues on github and I will resolve. I will make this open source and will accept pull requests. 


##Features: 
- Glassmorphism Buttons as React Components - Import anywhere in your react app 
- 11 Color Sets to Start just set variant prop to change colors
- 5 Rounding Options - set rounding prop to change rounding 
- Default color - If you don't set, clear is used 
- Default rounding - 0.25rem if you don't set a rounding prop
- Customizable button name - set the name prop to change the button text
- Ready for import to any project

## How to install
Run `npm i glass-buttons` to download and install the package
Then import the package in any component by calling `import GlassButton from 'glass-buttons'`
Then call the button with up to 3 customizable options `<GlassButton variant="primary" name="Primary" roun/>`


### How to use: 
```javascript
      <GlassButton variant="primary" name="primary" rounding="rounded-none"/> 
      <GlassButton variant="secondary" name="secondary" rounding="rounded-small"/>
      <GlassButton variant="danger" name="danger" rounding="rounded-large"/> 
      <GlassButton variant="success" name="success" rounding="rounded-xlarge"/> 
      <GlassButton variant="info" name="i" rounding="rounded-full"/> 
```
The code above produces the following output:

#### You can use it just like any button component and add onClick()
```javascript
<GlassButton variant="primary" name="Primary" rounding="rounded-none" onClick={handleClick}/> 
```

## Button Variants (Colors)
- Primary
- Secondary
- Danger
- Success
- Info
- Light
- Dark
- Warning
- Link
- Default

## Button Name
The name value is the text within the button. If none is specified the default is 'BUTTON'. By default the current version pushes .toUpperCase() on the button text. 

## Styles - Rounding
The following are valid styles and their applications. Rounded-small is default. 
Border Style    |   Property
-------------   |   -----------
rounded-none    |   none;
rounded-small   |   0.25rem;
rounded-large   |   0.5rem;
rounded-xlarge  |   1.5rem;
rounded-full    |   9999px;

These are applied by setting the `rounded` property when calling the library. `<GlassButton variant="danger" name="Primary" rounding="rounded-large"/> `

The `rounded-full` is designed to be used along side an icon library for displaying a single character or icon. 

## Text Color
Text color is set to Inherit on all buttons except Dark, it's set to white. This can be overridden in css. 

## Hover Effect
All of the buttons have a hover effect that changes the opacity from 0.1 to 0.8. The exception is the Dark theme which changes the opacity from 0.8 to 0.1 on hover. 

## Overrides
You can override the styling of these buttons by calling the CSS class buttonComponent. 
```javascript
 .buttonComponent { margin-left: 20%;} 
 ```

You can override a particular style by calling the CSS Class buttonComponentvariant where variant is changed to the name of the variant above such as ```.buttonComponentprimary {padding: 1rem} ```
